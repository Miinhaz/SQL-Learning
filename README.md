# **SQL Learning Journey**

This repository documents my learning experience with SQL, focusing on **MySQL database management**. Throughout this journey, I explored key SQL concepts, practical insights, and hands-on projects that demonstrate the use of SQL for efficient data storage, querying, and manipulation.

## **What I Learned**

### 1. **Database Creation**
   - Designing optimized databases with proper structure and normalization techniques to avoid redundancy and ensure data integrity.

### 2. **Queries & Joins**
   - Crafting complex SQL queries using `SELECT`, `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, and other clauses to extract meaningful insights from relational data.

### 3. **Data Manipulation**
   - Performing efficient data manipulation operations, including `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`, to manage records within the database.

### 4. **Indexing & Performance Optimization**
   - Improving query performance by implementing indexing strategies and understanding how indexes affect retrieval speed.

### 5. **Subqueries & Views**
   - Utilizing subqueries to handle complex queries and creating views to simplify data access and enhance database manageability.

### 6. **Stored Procedures & Triggers**
   - Automating repetitive database tasks using stored procedures and triggers, ensuring consistency and reducing manual intervention.

### 7. **String Functions**
   - Manipulating string data with functions such as `TRIM()`, `CONCAT()`, and `SUBSTRING()` to format and extract information from text-based fields.

### 8. **Subqueries & Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**
   - Writing advanced subqueries and using **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)** to simplify complex queries and improve query readability.

### 9. **Temporary Tables**
   - Creating and managing temporary tables to store and process intermediate results during complex data processing operations.

### 10. **Events**
   - Automating scheduled database tasks with **MySQL events**, allowing efficient time-based execution of queries.
